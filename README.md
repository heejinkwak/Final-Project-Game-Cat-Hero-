# Final-Project-Game-Cat-Hero-

CAT HERO! is a shooting game where the player needs to protect their cat from eating dangerous foods. 

There is 1 stage in this game. In the stage, player can use left/right keys to move accordingly and spacebar to shoot (throw) rocks. As foods randomly fall from the sky, the player needs to shoot at the dangerous foods (grape, onion, chocolate) and avoid them as well. Player will lose lives when they get hit too much. However, they are given 2 extra lives, so the game will not be very difficult to play. As the player continues with the game, safe food items (chicken and salmon) will appear. If the player takes this, they will be given 10 extra points and their life will increase.
